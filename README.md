# DevGram

![](https://github.com/devgram-openhack/mobile/raw/master/src/assets/logo.png)

An Android / iOS app to improve the experience of everyone involved in hackathons, by allowing participants to post their projects / ideas and receive feedback from the community through likes, dislikes and comments. It also makes the process of joining a team easier, allowing the participant to filter through the user base for users that might be of interest, and automatically creating a team if the interest is mutual.

## Usage

**WARNING: This app is not ready for production. It does not connect to a database, all of the data in the app is only available during runtime. You will lose all changes made when you re-open the app. This is for testing purposes only, so that you can see how it's supposed to work.**

Download the .apk through the [releases](https://github.com/devgram-openhack/mobile/releases) page.

Deployment for iOS is currently not available as we have no access to a Mac.
